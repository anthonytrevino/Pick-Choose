# Pick-Choose
Activity randomizer. Help indecisive individuals decide their activities by spinning a wheel. 

Takes user geolocation and can display nearby movies, or restaurants. Can possibly show users recipes that they can make using an ingredient of their choice, and other various random activities in the wildcard section.

Uses yelp API, food database API, movieshowing API.
I worked in a group with other developers and focused on incorporating the food database api interaction to display recipes to the user.
